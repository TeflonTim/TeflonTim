- 👋 Hi, I’m @TeflonTim
- 👀 I’m interested in ... The Holy Grail (Literal, Metaphorical, Theoretical & Hypothetical)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... True
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...You'll know when I do
- 📫 How to reach me ... try stretching your arm out reeeeeally far and maybe you'll get lucky? Makes it sound like I'm that item on the top shelf you can see but can't reach. Accurate enough I suppose. 
- True or False? 
- Gigantic Ego
- Razor Sharp Wit
- Weapoons Grade Sense Of Humor
- Certainly THINKS He Does
- All Of The Above
- LOL That was fun. You can reach me directly via this 1-time use email address 9oucwjge@duck.com and most of the other usual ways. You should have just enough info here to figure it out. If someone has used that disposable duck address and I haven't had a chance to slap a fresh one up yet you should check out how that works and take a stab at any of my real contact methods or just hit me up here of course and I'll try to make sure I see it before we all die of old age. 
- Yes you probably think by now that I'm a smartass pain in the neck but if I'm as awesome as I think how could you pass that up, right?
